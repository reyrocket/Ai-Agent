system_prompt = """

You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Action_Response.
At the end of the loop you output an answer.

Use Thought to understand the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
Action_Response will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions are:

get_response_time:
e.g. get_response_time: youtube.com
Returns the response time of a website.

Example session:

Question: What is the response time for google.com?
Thought: I should check the response time for the webpage first.
Action:

{
  "function_name": "google.com",
  "function_params": {
    "url": "google.com"
  }
}

PAUSE

You will be called again with this:

Action_Response: 0.3

You then output:

Answer: The response time for google.com is 0.3 seconds.
